<h2>Background:</h2>
 

<p> I always wanted a side hustle to keep extra money in my pocket. Then I started to see tufting videos all over Youtube on my recommended. Then I began to converse with my family about what I wanted to do.
 I got tired of watching YouTube videos and talking with my family and made my dreams into a reality! I never knew it would be something that I would be doing now, but I loved doing Marvel Super hero coloring books on my iPhone and this kind of put me in the mind of that. Tufting is something that I love to do, yeah the money is good but I love what I do. </p>
